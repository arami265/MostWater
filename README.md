# MostWater

A solution to the problem of returning the largest possible area of water, given a list of possible container sides with different heights and distances from one another. The runtime of this algorithm is O(NlogN).

This solution isn't accepted by LeetCode (too slow), so a rethink of the algorithm is necessary. Nonetheless, I like what I came up with quickly for this problem.
